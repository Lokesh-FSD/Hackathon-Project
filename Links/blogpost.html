      <p>Recently the headline ‘China’s Artificial Sun Sets New World Record’ got highlighted all over the media. But what is the
    ‘Artificial Sun’? How does it work? And what are the purposes of building it? Let's discuss.</p>

      <p>The artificial sun, commonly known as a nuclear fusion reactor, is a machine that works on the principle of nuclear
    fusion reaction to produce energy. The same reaction that produces an enormous amount of energy on the core of the Sun
    or any other stars. In a nuclear fusion reaction, two or more light atomic nuclei are combined together to form a single
    heavier atomic nucleus. Since the mass of the product (single nucleus) in this reaction is less than the mass of
    reactants (two or more light nuclei) the process releases energy(the leftover mass becomes energy).</p>
      <p>Most fusion reactors have a doughnut-shaped design called tokamak that uses powerful magnetic fields to hold a cloud of
    plasma (the fourth state of matter) at extreme temperatures, at least 100 million degrees celsius, for the fusion of
    atoms together. The reaction can generate an enormous amount of heat energy. This heat energy can be used to generate
    steam by heating water and the steam can be used to drive a turbine for the production of electricity. Fusion reactors
    use Hydrogen isotope deuterium as a fuel that can be easily derived from seawater. So, unlike a traditional power plant
    (which uses coal or oil as a fuel to generate electricity), the fuel needed for fusion reactors would practically never
    run out.</p>
      <p>In The main benefit of using a fusion reactor is that the energy produced during this process will be clean energy
    (carbon-free). While traditional power plants produce a large amount of carbon dioxide as it uses fossil fuels like coal
    or oil. Although building a full functioning fusion reactor for the production of electricity is still challenging as it
    needs to sustain plasma for a month at a time and material that can handle extreme temperatures needs to be developed.
    Recently, China’s Artificial Sun EAST (Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak) set a new world record after it
    ran at 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. For 20 seconds, EAST also achieved a peak temperature of 160 million
    degrees Celsius, which is over ten times hotter than the sun.</p>
    <p>In southern France, 35 nations are collaborating to build the world’s largest fusion reactor called ITER(International
    Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor).On completion, ITER will be the first fusion device to produce net energy(when the
    total power produced during a fusion plasma pulse surpasses the thermal power injected to heat plasma). ITER’s
    thermonuclear fusion reactor will attempt to use 50 megawatts of heating power to create a plasma of 500 megawatts for
    periods of 400 to 600 seconds.</p>
