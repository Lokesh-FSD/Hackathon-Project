        <p>Whether you realize it or not, many of us live in buildings with some smart capacity. You probably have at least one
        smart device in your home.
        
        With the smart device industry set to grow by $65 billion by 2024, the odds are, you’ll add more of these devices. The
        true potential of smart homes lies in the ability of smart devices to communicate together — and that’s where blockchain
        technology comes in.</p>
<br>
<h2>How Blockchain is Being Used With Smart Buildings</h2>
            <p>On the surface, smart technologies make individual tasks easier, but the potential is much larger than that. A smart
            device is effectively a sensor able to collect significant amounts of data about everything, from your energy use to how
            well-stocked your fridge is.</p>

            <p>Blockchain technologies are working to provide the solution to these challenges and others since they can enable P2P
            connections without the need for a centralized validator.
            
            With blockchain, it would be possible to connect numerous smart devices without being forced to hand that data directly
            over to the device manufacturer, mitigating privacy and security concerns. It can also provide increased transparency
            over how data is used, helping users understand what data their smart home is collecting and what it’s used for.
            
            Blockchain technology is also hardware agnostic. Thus, it would be possible for users to pair together devices from
            different manufacturers without worrying about compatibility.</p>

           <p> Blockchain has been shown to resolve both the problem of data breaches as well as hacking takeovers. Capturing a
        blockchain-powered device would require compromising the entire blockchain itself compromised.
        
        But proper validation, such as that proposed by IOTA, allows malicious devices to be pruned from the network,
        significantly improving security.
        
        Additionally, blockchain could enable consumers to understand how their data is being used, helping to make smart
        devices more privacy-focused.
        
        Smart Building Management Solutions are Already Being Tested
        The value of blockchain technology becomes even bigger at scale. One of the most impactful uses of IoT and blockchain
        technology is in building management. Whether for an apartment building or an office building, it’s often difficult to
        effectively manage a building’s heating, lighting, and security in a way that minimizes waste.
        
        Example: How Blockchain Could Manage Heating Bills
        In a traditional setting, most buildings are managed centrally. If there is a unified heating system, it is often
        controlled by the local administration. Although this system is more efficient than individually-heated buildings, there
        is significant room for human error. That’s because the system is not optimized to account for more efficient heating
        higher up in the building as heat rises.
        
        A network of heating sensors could be used to automatically measure the temperature in each apartment or office in a
        building. If the different thermostats could communicate with each other, it should be possible to input all the data
        into a blockchain solution.
